Dear <%= @fname%>


Thanks for signing up to the pastonpaper.com Mailing list.  Don't worry, we won't spam you!  If you want to leave the list at any time, just reply to this message with the Subject "Remove".

Pastonpaper.com is a unique website which connects Genealogists and Local Historians with antique documents and photographs offered for sale (or just for display) by dealers and individuals across the world.  You can search the collection by name, place, date or a combination of all three.  You can also upload you family tree and we will tell you as soon as anyone offers anything for sale that relates to you research interests.

I'm hoping to launch the site very soon - it's getting closer every day, but it's a one man effort.  If you'd like to get involved and help with the hundreds of tasks I still have to do, or if you'd like to start uploading your items ready for the launch, please do drop me an email any time (christian@pastonpaper.com)


Best Regards
