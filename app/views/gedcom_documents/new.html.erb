    <p>Gedcom Files are computer files generated by all major Genealogy Applications and websites containing a portable snapshot of your family tree.  Soon, these files will be used by The Past on Paper to quickly check against all items listed on our website, and to see whether any items in our stock list relate to your research.</p>
    <p>We will soon be providing help guides to getting the gedcom files out of your favourite application or website.  If the guide for your favourite software or website is missing, please let us know.  If you can help produce a guide, we would love to hear from you.</p>
