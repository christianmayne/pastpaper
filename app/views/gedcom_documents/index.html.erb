  <p><span class="headline4" style="margin-right:0; padding-right:0;">Gedcom Files</span> are computer files generated by all major Genealogy Applications and websites containing a portable snapshot of your family tree.  Soon, these files will be used by The Past on Paper to quickly check against all items listed on our website, and to see whether any items in our stock list relate to your research.  We will check and inform you whenever new items are added that may be of interest.  Although the search is not quite ready, files uploaded now will be searched before the feature is publically announced, giving you first possible chance to obtain your family heirlooms.</p>
  <p>We will soon be providing help guides to getting the gedcom files out of your favourite application or website.  If the guide for your favourite software or website is missing, please let us know.  If you can help produce a guide, we would love to hear from you</p>
  <p><i>The Past on Paper will not disclose your gedcom files to any third party</i></p>
