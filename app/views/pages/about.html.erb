    <span class="headline4"><a href="http://www.pastonpaper.com">The Past on Paper</a></span> connects Genealogists and Historians with unique research from private collections and dealerships.<br /><br />
    <span class="headline4">As Genealogists,</span> we all know the feeling of hoping that large dusty Bible in the antique shop would contain the family register related to our family.  Or that shoebox of Carte d'Visites might contain that unseen image of an elusive Great Great Grandfather.  You may have found the name scribbled on the back of a photo and wandered how you can get it back into the hands of the family.
    <br /><br />
    <span class="headline4">The Past on Paper</span> has been developed by a Genealogist to solve these problems.  Now dealers and individuals alike can list their items free of charge to share, gift or sell to family members and researchers.  As well as reuniting families with long lost heirlooms, we aim to build a large database of unique data, sourced from documents undocumented elsewhere.  Before the advent of Civil Registration in 1837, there was no centralised source for the recording of Births Marriages or Deaths in the United Kingdom, and genealogists often supplement Baptism for Birth and Burial for Death.  Family Bibles stretching back to the 1600s can often provide the actual dates, unrecorded elsewhere.
    <br /><br />
    <span class="headline4">Development</span> has been by <a href="http://www.christian-mayne.net">Christian Mayne</a>, a part time antiques dealer and a long-time genealogist who began acquiring antique photographs in the mid 1990s, and felt the items in his stock list would have more value to researchers of family or local history, than as decorative pieces.  For several years Christian has researched the Family Registers in Family Bibles and reunited them with the grateful original families.  The success of this endeavour has lead to the development of www.pastonpaper.com, in the hope that others will be encouraged to list their items
