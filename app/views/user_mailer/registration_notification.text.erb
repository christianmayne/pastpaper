Dear <%= @user.first_name %>

Thank you for registering on pastonpaper.com.

It's still very early days for the site, and only a very limited set of features have been enabled.  Currently you can search for items from my personal collection, view full item details, including place and location information, contact the item owner for further information, upload your gedcom details and edit your profile.

You can't currently buy or sell through the site, but this is coming very very soon, and not everyone can list their own items just yet.  If you have indicated that you wish to list your items on the site, I will be in touch seperately with instructions.

This is still a one-man project, and there's still lots to do. If you think you could help out in anyway, I'd love to hear from you!   You may encounter a few bugs along the way  please do feel free to drop me an email if something doesn't appear tobe working right.

In the meantime, please do like us on facebook, or follow us on Twitter or Pinterest, and bookmark our occasionally updated blog for news as it happens!  All the links are at the bottom of this email


Best Regards

Christian Mayne
